Algorithms in Go
=================

This repository is a notebook for data structures and algorithms implemented in [Go](http://golang.org/). Examples are derived from sources listed in [references](#References). Each example is in a separate file, with a corresponding file for tests and benchmarks. Since I am new to Go, some code may not be idiomatic. To suggest an improvement, please submit a pull request or create an issue. 

### Running Tests

```bash
$ go test
```

With benchmarks:

```bash
$ go test -bench=.
```
