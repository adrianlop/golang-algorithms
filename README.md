Algorithms in Go
=================

This repository is a notebook for algorithm implementations in Go. The initial work will be derived primarily from examples in Sedgewick's *[Algorithms in C](http://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Parts-1-5-Bundle-Fundamentals/dp/0201756080/)*. I am just learning Go and also would like to brush up on algorithms before studying parsing techniques and crypto in depth. The plan is to add one or two examples per day, with tests and benchmarks. Wish me luck ;-)
